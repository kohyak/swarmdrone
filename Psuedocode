#Psuedocode for the drone

# Algorithm organization
  #Finite state machine
    # States: Start(), Tracking(), Avoid(), Land()
    
  #Interrupt threads
  
#Startup
  #Confirm all sensors present/working
  #Initialize sensors
  #Initialize ground robot tracking camera
  #Calibrate ground robot tracking camera? 
     #(possible difficulties as no floor reference?)
  #Check motors?
     #(unsure if possible?)
  #Zero height sensor
  #Check proximity sensors
  #OK to fly
  #Rise to predetermined altitude
  
#Tracking
  #Detect april tag
  #Ground robot tracking
  #Check battery life to determine when to begin landing procedure
  #Rotate in direction of movement
  #Check proximity sensors to determine if clear to move in goal direction
  #If clear: 
    Move to april tag location (speed porpotional to distance from goal position)
  #If obscured: 
    Obstacle avoidance procedure
    
#Landing
  #Check proximity sensors
  #Check safe distance to ground robot
  #Begin descent
  #Confirm ground robot is stationary
  #When within certain altitude, ramp down motors
  #Shutoff motors
